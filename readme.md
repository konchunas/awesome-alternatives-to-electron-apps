> A curated list of _awesome_ apps which don't suck.

[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) is an application platform which spreads like a cancer in software development world making your immensely powerful computer feel slow and laggy. Sometimes apps made in Electron are useful, though. This list contains good alternatives to an memory hungry eco-unfriendly Electron software.

It is usually easy to find software on the other end of the spectrum: ultra-minimalist software on the brink of being unusable. Here we prefer to strike a balance between being featurefull and not beign resource demanding.
